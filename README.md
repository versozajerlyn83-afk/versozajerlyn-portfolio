Building this portfolio was a rewarding experience that allowed me to apply and expand my web development skills. As an IT student, I wanted a project that could showcase what Iâ€™ve learned so far and serve as a foundation to build upon as I grow. 
During development, I focused on creating a clean, user-friendly layout with semantic HTML, responsive design, and basic interactivity using JavaScript. Implementing features like a dark/light mode toggle and form validation helped me deepen my understanding of client-side scripting and user experience. 
One of the challenges I faced was ensuring the site was responsive and accessible on different devices. I learned how to use CSS media queries effectively and test across screen sizes. Additionally, balancing design aesthetics with functionality was a valuable lesson in prioritizing user needs. 
Overall, this project taught me the importance of planning a clear structure, writing clean code, and iterating based on feedback. Moving forward, I plan to add more complex projects, improve design skills, and explore backend development to make my portfolio even stronger. 
Creating this portfolio not only boosted my confidence but also motivated me to keep learning and improving as a web developer.
